For backend

How do i setup

1. cd to the backend folder
2. npm install
3. then because my window is in restricted mode so it cannot run script, change from the windows powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
4. then i will need to compile my typescript file to javascript using 'tsc'
5. then it says 'dotenv' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
6. went to stackoverflow 
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61407393/while-running-the-script-throws-cannot-find-module-dotenv
7. add a line of command npm install -g dotenv-cli
8. tada it works for backend
9. need to npm install zod
10. need to npm install mysql2 for sql connection


For frontend

1. is just npm install
2. npm install axios react-router-dom
3. npm run dev that is it

import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react-swc'
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'

// https://vite.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react(), tailwindcss()],
})

index.css and App.css all clear out and write
@import "tailwindcss"
